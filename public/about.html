<p>
  Hi I'm Alisha Arora,  I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, Canada’s top engineering school.
  Currently, I’m at TELUS, using computer vision to precisely isolate and analyze objects in satellite images to monitor deforestation and natural disaster impacts. 
  Previously, I conducted research under Dr. Ghosh at MIT, developing machine learning models to explore the relationship between the gut microbiome and schizophrenia. At Procter & Gamble, I worked on the Always YOU app, building the front-end for a menstrual and well-being tracker created in collaboration with Thrive Global. I also worked on a chatbot for Vitala Global’s abortion care tool, enhancing accessibility for users worldwide.
  My passion for combining technology and social impact has led me to be recognized as one of Canada’s Top 100 Most Powerful Women, serve as a member of the World Economic Forum's AI Council and as a UNICEF Youth Ambassador. My work has been featured on Forbes, Microsoft, and I've spoken to over 30,000 people at various tech conferences.
